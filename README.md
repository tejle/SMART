# Model Based Testing with SMART
The fundamental problem with automated functional testing is that it is usually introduced late in the development process when the product is more mature and stable. This significantly reduces the time available for test automation ROI. To mitigate this we introduce SMART, a tool that enables test automation even before the actual product is available.

SMART uses a simple graphical representation for your requirements, making it possible to both early validation of your requirements and automated verification of your product when it becomes available.

With SMART you do not need to handle costly maintenance of stale or obsolete suites of test-scripts as your requirements or priorities change. 

As SMART creates test sequences when you actually execute your testing, it can react on defects found in your software and adapt its strategies to better map out the real problem. Stale scripts usually just terminate on first defect found leaving the detective work to manual testers.

### SMART has both a graphical UI and a console interface making it ideal for continuous integration and other agile work methods.

Realizing that you already have tools you use. SMART does not try to do everything or replace anything, instead we integrate and expand the possibilities of the tools you already have and use.

With SMART you will be able to produce and maintain automated verification more easily and efficient. Creating requirement models in SMART encourage early involvement of validation in the product lifecycle. This leads to early feedback and verification sometimes even before you have a product to verify. SMART also provides you with reports and information about test coverage, defect flows and how requirement changes will affect your product. This will give you more predictable testing and a higher product quality.

## Be a smarter tester â€“ use SMART!
